## Tools Used: Plotly, D3.JS, iGraph, Tableau

Assignment:

### Part A:

- Use the D3 library to draw the (x,y) data pairs in the ![dataset](https://github.com/kavyakavuri/CS526-Data-Interaction-and-Visual-Analytics/blob/8bb38f002907e3f3c1a0b04b2467a4fb94657316/Homeworks/HW3%20-%20Comparing%20different%20graph%20visualization%20tools/cit-Patents-with-header.csv)
- Use the Plotly to draw the same (x,y) data pairs.
- Now please use the Software Tableau (Links to an external site.) to draw the same (x,y) pair data.
- Compare levels of interaction between Tableau, D3, and Plotly.
- Which one will be best for your project (if any)?

Part B:

- Graphs Data - Get subgraph data files from here (Links to an external site.).
- The first number after cit-Patents corresponds to the number of edges in the given subgraph.

- **Drawing Software:** Use Tableau or Gephi or D3 or GraphViz or Network X or Mathematica or Neoj4. Draw in size order selected graphs on different Edge sizes ![2^10](https://github.com/kavyakavuri/CS526-Data-Interaction-and-Visual-Analytics/blob/8bb38f002907e3f3c1a0b04b2467a4fb94657316/Homeworks/HW3%20-%20Comparing%20different%20graph%20visualization%20tools/cit-Patents_1092_919138.csv), ![2^13](https://github.com/kavyakavuri/CS526-Data-Interaction-and-Visual-Analytics/blob/8bb38f002907e3f3c1a0b04b2467a4fb94657316/Homeworks/HW3%20-%20Comparing%20different%20graph%20visualization%20tools/cit-Patents_7315_1037462.csv) and ![2^15](https://github.com/kavyakavuri/CS526-Data-Interaction-and-Visual-Analytics/blob/8bb38f002907e3f3c1a0b04b2467a4fb94657316/Homeworks/HW3%20-%20Comparing%20different%20graph%20visualization%20tools/cit-Patents_103101_508033.csv).
- Challenge: Draw the largest you can in order of sizes using any of the named software.
- The largest drawn subgraph with at least 2<sup>13</sup> edges will get 20 points extra credit.

Submit Snapshots of your best drawings. Label each drawing with the subgraph name and the software used.

**Graph Drawing Software:** Use any non-Rutgers software different from Tableau, Gephi, D3, GraphVis, Network X, Mathematica, or Neoj4 that you can find on the web<br><br>
**Challenge:** Draw the largest subgraph you can in order of sizes using the named software.
The largest drawn subgraph with at least 2<sup>13</sup> edges will get 20 points extra credit.

Submit Snapshots of your best drawings. Label each drawing with the subgraph name and the software used.

Free Drawing -Draw in any way you can any of the given subgraphs with the number of edges close to 2<sup>16</sup>

*A comprehensible drawing will get you 40 points extra credit regardless of how long the software took to produce the given layout.
